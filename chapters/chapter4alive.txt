Chapter IV: The House||After Yafeu and I make it to our neighborhood, I turn the bend back towards my house and he continues on straight. Our journey back from school had been a mental and physical challenge neither of us expected that day.

On the way back, I had called my dad to tell him everything that happened. He was shocked to say the least. He mentioned calling the authorities and apologized a million times over. It was comforting to hear those things, but deep inside that wasn’t why I called him. Sharing today’s events with somebody else solidified them as undoubtable facts. Yafeu and I were robbed. Yafeu was almost killed. The only times my mind had ever encountered such morbidities had been in the annals of history. Even now, part of me wants to brush today’s events away… to categorize them with the distant stories of the past.

I asked my dad not to tell mom or Talha about what had happened that day. They didn’t deserve to have the joy of Ireji taken away from them too.

By the time I got home, my dad was parked in the driveway. I walk past his car without saying anything to him and shake my head to clear my thoughts.  Leaving all of my pain on the doorsteps, I enter the house.||
