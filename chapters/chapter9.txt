Chapter IX: The Cure?||The Individual. Both the functional unit of a society and its greatest danger. In all of our teachings from elders, parents, teachers, and siblings, Karasi’s way was made painstakingly clear: community came first. Ingrained into the minds of every Karasian since they learned our tongue, this was a defining characteristic of our people—so intrinsic to our spirits as to have been embedded in the minds and souls governing our thoughts and actions.

Or so we thought.

Had the effects of IMPIR been purely physical… it needn’t even reach local news. Through the collaboration of our nations healers and scientists, no infectious disease had been made mention of outside the four walls of our History classrooms. The Earth had never failed in guiding us to its healing fruits, and there was no reason to believe IMPIR would be any different. The problem wasn’t that a cure couldn’t be found, but that the spiritual and emotional chaos that the disease caused had seeped in the very fabric of our nation, making the search impossible.

The elders seemed to think that our society was too far gone, that nothing we could do would loosen the disase's hold on our people and return us to our communitarian roots. Could that really be true? Even during the final days of Ireji?||
