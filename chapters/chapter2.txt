Chapter II: Breakfast||September 20th, 2020. 8 AM.

The alarm clock’s fluorescent red flashes as I finally keel over in my bed, remembering what day it is.

“{{ name }}, so this is how you want to start your final year of school? If I come up those stairs now, we will not see peace in this house!” On any other day, my mom’s frantic yells would have done little to get me out of my bed. But, today was different. September 20th may have been the first day of school, but it also was the first day of the Ireji ceremony.

By the time I make it to the breakfast table, it’s only 8:17. As I shift my gaze from the wall clock to the plate in front of me, my eyes are greeted with the most beautiful of sights. Quickly reading the joy off my face, my mom brags,  “The yam porridge and puff puff you’ve been asking for all week. I’m surprised you made it while it’s still hot.”

I almost want to be offended by her second comment, but given its accuracy I just say thank you.

As I scarf down my breakfast, I notice the couch is empty.

“Dad must already be at work, huh?”

“Yes, he left about an hour ago. With the start of the Ireji ceremony today, they asked your father to manage any injuries from early morning harvests.”

“Ahh, that makes sense. And Talha?”

“Your sister’s enjoying her tenth hour of sleep right now. Middle school starts next week remember?”

That is true. I always used to relish the extra week of summer session in middle school. And despite all her genius, Talha would never sacrifice any extra sleep. But, after us all being together almost every morning over these past few months, today felt... lonely. Last semester wasn’t any different, but for some reason this unsettled feeling is much more inescapable now.||

##Brush it off//Tell your mom about how you feel##

**The wall clock’s long hand was already gliding over 9. I brush off my unease and dash out the door. “Bye Mom!” I still can see her warm smile and gentle wave as I turn the bend towards school.//“Mom does today feel a little lonely—” I pause for a moment, “or strange to you? Are the spirits unsettled or something?”

She stares to the ceiling, briefly thinking to herself, “The spirits were a little more active than usual this morning, but it’s probably because of Ireji. You might just feel a little anxious for your first harvest {{ name }}. Anyway, you should start heading to school before you're late.”
