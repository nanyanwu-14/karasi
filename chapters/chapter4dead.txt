Chapter IV: The House||After an hour of interrogation by the authorities, I nestled into the worn down seat of my family’s Sakura Electric. The investigators had been persistent, questioning me about each decision that I made.

“Why did you follow that man into the alleyway?”

“I don’t know. He was older than us so we wanted to be respectful.”

“What did the man look like?”

“Tall. Mid-40s. Dark hair and pale skin.”

“Why did he kill Yafeu?”

“Because I—”

No matter how many times they asked this question, I could never muster the strength to admit that it was my fault. If I had just listened to the robber’s demands, the cold loneliness I’ve felt since that moment would be replaced with the sense of security I feel in the presence of Yafeu’s warm, energetic smile. Instead, I decided to ridicule the man, and now the coldness persists. Do I stand by everything that I said? Yes, without question. But was it worth a life… Yafeu’s life?

Snapping me back into the present, my dad turns down the radio as we slowly roll into the driveway. Today was one of those few days where he let the radio speak for him until he fully gathered what he needed to say.

“I’m sorry. If I had just driven a little faster I could’ve been there to heal Yafeu when he needed it. I’m sorry {{ name }}, you shouldn’t have had to experience that. ”

I could see he was holding back his tears.||“Dad, can I ask you for a favor?”

He looks back at me slowly, “Of course.”

“Please don’t tell mom or Talha about what happened today. At least not until Ireji is over.”

He pauses for a little, before hesitantly nodding his head in agreement. Mom and Talha didn’t deserve to have their Ireji taken away from them too.

When I finally exit the car, I can tell that I’ve been forever changed by today’s events. I try to clear everything out of my system as I approach the door. Leaving all of my pain on the doorsteps, I enter the house.||

##Be realistic//Be silent//Thank him##

**“Be honest with yourself Dad. What could you have actually done? All you do everyday is heal minor wounds sustained in the fields or the mines. Have you ever had to hold the lifeless hands of your closest friend? HAVE YOU?”

My dad fell silent. What could he say? He knew I was right. Throughout my lifetime and likely his, a murder had never occurred in Karasi. The purpose of healers was never to save lives but to just improve their quality. I wonder if he’s ever even seen a dead body.

I calm myself down before moving to exit the car. With the door halfway open, I remember one thing.//After all the screams and questions, my voice had been completely ripped out of me. I simply nod my head and move to exit the car.

With the door halfway open, I remember one thing.//“Thanks Dad, but it’s not your fault. I should’ve done more to save Yafeu. My decisions are what led to this.”

The truth I had been averting since Yafeu’s body hit the concrete was finally released. With that, maybe Yafeu’s soul and my own could find peace.

My father, recognizing that I had things figured out in my own way, just nods his head before turning the car off. As I move to exit the car, I remember one thing.**
