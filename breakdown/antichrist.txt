The realist Antichrist in this telling of the apocalypse advances the effects of IMPIR and aids in society’s demise while hiding under a veil of kind lies. The Antichrist gains the trust of all members of pronoun2 community and in practice, is almost indistinguishable from Christ. As the final enemy, pronoun1 stays undetected throughout the story. The user does not know that pronoun2 actions are dangerous to humanity until the final chapter where it is revealed that pronoun2 white lies, staunch defense, and appeals to violence only furthered the death and destruction of the apocalypse. In Kevin Hughes’ The Formation of AntiChrist in Medieval Western Christian Thought, “an important facet of Antichrist’s symbolic power is this ‘sense of ending’, the sense that present choices, present failures, are connected intimately, corporally, to an uncertain future. If Antichrist symbolically embodies human evil, it is always an evil that is in process, in motion in time and history.” Throughout the story, the Antichrist represents the human evils of dishonesty, placation, recklessness, and glory. Through the Antichrist, we learn more of our own sins.
