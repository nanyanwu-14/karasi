In an apocalypse, a survivalist is one who does not know or care for the causes underlying the rapture, as these causes are out of their control. What was in pronoun2 control, however, is how pronoun1 fared in the context of the apocalyptic environment pronoun1 was placed in. In such an environment, a survivalist does whatever pronoun1 can to ensure pronoun2 own safety and the safety of pronoun2 loved ones, at any moral cost.

In our story, the survivalist trope is played out in exactly this way. Choices that indicate a focus on safety, preparation, and self-preservation lend themselves to this character archetype. The survivalist makes choices in these interests to and even past the point where they directly clash with the cultural, spiritual, and moral values that the character holds dear. The survivalist is heavily inspired by the character Neville in R. Matheson's I Am Legend. Through witnessing death and torment, Neville is stripped of his humanity and is fundamentally changed. Similarly, the user that plays the survivalist leaves pronoun2 nation and relatives, a choice that is very uncharacteristic of a Karasian who values nation and family above all.

The survivalist is often depicted as the last man on earth. Much like in George G. Byron's Darness, surviving the apocalypse comes with the burden of watching society's downfall up until its very end. As such, the user that plays the survivalist was forced to reckon with death, violence, and decay as pronoun1 left Karasi. Pronoun1 saw images of their green lively city transformed into a lifeless desolate battleground.
