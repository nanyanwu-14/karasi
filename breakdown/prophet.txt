The prophet in a biblical interpretation receives word from a deity to deliver their divine message to humanity, most notably a warning about the coming of an apocalypse. A succinct definition of a prophet can be found in this passage, “Then the Lord put forth His hand and touched my mouth, and the Lord said to me, ‘Behold, I have put My words in your mouth. See, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms to root out and pull down, to destroy and to throw down, to build and to plant’” (Jeremiah 1:9-11, NKJV).

Throughout the story, the Prophet is able to reject political and religious authority that has been corrupted (much like conspiracy theory researchers in Ted Daniel’s A Doomsday Reader) and follows through with pronoun2 instincts that have been largely guided by the spirits. As such, the Prophet has an uneasy feeling from the beginning and acts upon that feeling to better assess the intentions of everyone affected by IMPIR. The prophet thus forsees the apocalypse and spreads that message by explaining to the mother about the parasite ridden crops. Later, pronoun1 displayed almost certainty in the cure offered by the coming together during the Ireji feast and put great faith in humanity.
